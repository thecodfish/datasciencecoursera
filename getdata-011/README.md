Measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement are asked for, therefore, only features where the string "mean()" or "std()" are included. Other instances ("fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-meanFreq()" or "angle(X,gravityMean)for example) indicate measurements other than mean and are not included.
